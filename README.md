 🫀 CVD Classification - Machine Learning Model Classification

This project focuses on **classifying cardiovascular disease (CVD)** using various machine learning algorithms and comparing their performance using standard evaluation metrics. The objective is to identify the most effective model based on confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.



📌 Project Highlights

- Applied and evaluated multiple classification algorithms
- Preprocessed and explored healthcare dataset
- Visualized results through plots and metric comparisons
- No user input or prediction — analysis-based project only
- Deployed results via Streamlit for educational demonstration

📊 Dataset

The dataset includes anonymized patient health records with the following features:

- Age
- Gender
- Blood Pressure (Systolic & Diastolic)
- Cholesterol and Glucose levels
